# *Re: Data Availability 
As per the data availability statement found in the manuscript, we are unable to publically release participant demographic data. As a result, the IDs and values found in the available data files are simulated (not real), and the IDs have been changed. In addition, we did not add the data and code used to create Table 1. For any questions, please contact the study PI, Michael Hutchison.


# .R files
**tables.R**: script to make Table & 2. 

**modelling_and_figures.R**: script to run all statistical models reported in the manuscript, and to create all figures and supplemental figures. 


# Key
