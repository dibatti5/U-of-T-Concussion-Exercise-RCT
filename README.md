This repository contains all the code used for results, tables*, and figures found in:

# *Re: Data Availability 
As per the data availability statement found in the manuscript, we are unable to publically release participant demographic data. As a result, the IDs and values found in the available data files are simulated (not real), and the IDs have been changed. In addition, we did not add the data and code used to create Table 1. For any questions, please contact the study PI, Michael Hutchison.


# .R files
**tables.R**: script to make Table 2. 
**modelling_and_figures.R**: script to run all statistical models reported in the manuscript, and to create all figures and supplemental figures. 


# .CSV files
**m1_df.csv**: simulated data file used to model days to asymptomatic status.
**m2_df.csv**: simulated data file used to model days to return-to-play.
**t2_df.csv**: simulated data file used to create manuscript Table 2.
**symp_df.csv**: simulated data file used to model symptoms throughout the trial.



# Key
**SAEP** = structured aerobic exercise prescription. 

**UCEP** = usual care exercie exercise prescription. 

**RTP** = Return To Play.
